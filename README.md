# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

The Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a Python-based Flask microservice that runs on a server and provides real-time analysis and protection for web applications. It leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze incoming traffic by sniffing network packets and making predictions based on a trained ML model.

## Features

- Real-time Traffic Analysis: The WAF captures and inspects network traffic to identify potential threats and attacks on web applications.
- Machine Learning Model: It utilizes a pre-trained ML model to classify traffic and make predictions about its maliciousness.
- Customizable Rule Set: The WAF allows you to define and configure custom rules to enhance the detection and protection capabilities.
- Logging and Reporting: It generates detailed logs and reports for analyzed traffic, including identified threats, classification results, and other relevant information.
- Integration with Flask: The WAF is built as a Flask microservice, making it easy to integrate into existing Flask-based web applications.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the WAF settings in the `config.py` file, including network interface, ML model path, and other options.
4. Start the WAF service: `python app.py`

For detailed instructions and additional configuration options, please refer to the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

## Usage

1. Ensure that the WAF service is running and listening on the specified network interface and port.
2. Integrate the WAF with your web application by directing incoming traffic to the WAF's endpoint or by configuring it as a reverse proxy.
3. The WAF will analyze the incoming traffic, classify it using the ML model, and apply the defined rules to identify and mitigate potential threats.
4. Monitor the WAF logs and reports for any detected threats or suspicious activities.

For more information on how to use and configure the WAF, please refer to the [User Guide](user-guide.md).
